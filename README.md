# UDVI RPC Server
UDVI RPC Server(yet to be named) is an asynchronous event-driven RPC server for rapid development of maintainable high performance servers & clients. UDVI RPC Server is based on [Netty](http://netty.io) 5.0.x

UDVI RPC Server is used as a container that hosts all the services that are built at UDVI.IO.

Base implementation is based on Lubin Wang's implementation [NettyRPC](https://github.com/dawnbreaks/NettyRPC) (Thanks a lot) which is based on 4.0.x.
